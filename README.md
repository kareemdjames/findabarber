Find a barber shop Proposal

What is Find a barber shop?

I would like to create a crud app that allows you to pull in a barber shop from the google maps api and if you like it you can save it to your favorites for later viewing

Initial thoughts on app structure

I expect to have some challenges with the google maps api and actually saving the information. I am not sure how I want this to look yet so I may have some issues with the layout I'm looking to achieve.

Phases of Completion

phase 4: Fill out my 3x5 cards to experiment with different views.

phase 3: Create structure for database 

phase 2: get express server up and running with connected db

phase 1: ejs html & css

phase 0: MVP

phase 1: auth
